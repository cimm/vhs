# VHS

VHS is a personal, private, family “YouTube” mini-website.

## Why

This mini-website is a digital video archive of our old [VHS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHS) & [Hi8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_mm_video_format) family cassettes that were collecting dust in the attic. Magnetic tape decays or molds, cassettes get lost. A digital format can easily be shared or viewed and is easier to back up.

## How

The videos and cover images are stored in a [Backblaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html) bucket (free up to 10GB). The [`casettes.json`](cassettes.json) file contains the metadata for each video (filename, title, length, …). A weekly cron job generates [signed URLs](https://www.suffix.be/blog/signed-urls-backblaze-b2/) for the video files and cover images and adds updates to the `cassettes.json` file. A simple HTML page loads the JSON via JavaScript and shows a retro-style cover image with the link to the video. Authentication is handled with a standard Apache `.htpasswd` system.

## Installation

Installation should be simple, the only dependency is Python to run the [generate](generate) script and the Backblaze B2 [command line tool](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/quick_command_line.html).

1. Authenticate B2 with an applicationKey and upload your videos and cover images.
2. Copy the repository to your webserver’s document root and edit the `cassettes.json` file as shown in the example.
3. Run the [generate](generate) Python script and pass it your Backblaze B2 bucket name: `./generate cassettes.json my-video-bucket`. This will generate a signed URL valid for one week for each of the videos and cover images.
4. Test the webpage, the images should load and you can watch the videos.
5. Add a cronjob to run the [generate](generate) script each week to refresh the video and cover images URLs.

### Cover image

Cover image can be created offline (the generated script does not generate cover images). I used [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/).

    ffmpeg -ss 00:00:10.00 -i path/to/video.mp4 -y -f image2 -vcodec mjpeg -vframes 1 path/to/cover.jpg

### Localization (optional)

The webpage copy is in Dutch but can easily be changed to fit your needs.

### VCR OSD Mono Font (optional)

The screenshot uses the retro [VCR OSD Mono](https://www.dafont.com/vcr-osd-mono.font) font by Riciery Leal for the text over the cover images. The font is free for personal and commercial use but I am not sure it can be freely redistributed so it’s not included in this repository. You can [download](https://www.dafont.com/vcr-osd-mono.font) and extract the font and place it in the `/fonts` folder.

## Development

The whole thing is a static website really but since it loads the videos from a JSON config file a local webserver is needed to view the result. This Python one-liner is probably the easiest way to get started. Next, open http://0.0.0.0:8080/ in your browser.

    python -m http.server 8080

## Sync

The local copy can easily be synced to the webserver via `rsync`.

    rsync --recursive --compress --delete --delete-excluded --exclude 'readme.md' -e ssh . USER@HOST:/var/www/vhs
